This paper proposes a speech representation disentanglement framework for *one-shot/any-to-any* voice conversion, which performs conversion across arbitrary speakers with only a single target-speaker utterance for reference. Vector quantization with contrastive predictive coding (VQCPC) is used for content encoding and mutual information (MI) is introduced as the correlation metric during training, to achieve proper disentanglement of content, speaker and pitch representations, by reducing their inter-dependencies in an *unsupervised* manner.

## Requirements
Python 3.6 is used, install [apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) for speeding up training (optional), other requirements are listed in 'requirements.txt':

	pip install -r requirements.txt


## Quick start with pre-trained models
ParallelWaveGAN is used as the vocoder, so firstly please install [ParallelWaveGAN](https://github.com/kan-bayashi/ParallelWaveGAN) to try the [pre-trained models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Flw6Z0K2QdRrTn5F-gVt6HdR9TRPiaKy/view?usp=sharing):

	python convert_example.py -s {source-wav} -r {reference-wav} -c {converted-wavs-save-path} -m {model-path}

For example:

	python convert_example.py -s test_wavs/p225_038.wav -r test_wavs/p334_047.wav -c converted -m checkpoints/useCSMITrue_useCPMITrue_usePSMITrue_useAmpTrue/VQMIVC-model.ckpt-500.pt

The converted wav is put in 'converted' directory.


## Training and inference:
*  Step1. Data preparation & preprocessing
1. Put VCTK corpus under directory: 'Dataset/'
2. Training/testing speakers split & feature (mel+lf0) extraction:

		python preprocess.py

*  Step2. model training:
1. Training with mutual information minimization (MIM):

		python train.py use_CSMI=True use_CPMI=True use_PSMI=True

3. Training without MIM:

		python train.py use_CSMI=False use_CPMI=False use_PSMI=False

*  Step3. model testing:
1. Put PWG vocoder under directory: 'vocoder/'
2. Inference with model trained with MIM:

		python convert.py checkpoint=checkpoints/useCSMITrue_useCPMITrue_usePSMITrue_useAmpTrue/model.ckpt-500.pt

3. Inference with model trained without MIM:

		python convert.py checkpoint=checkpoints/useCSMIFalse_useCPMIFalse_usePSMIFalse_useAmpTrue/model.ckpt-500.pt
